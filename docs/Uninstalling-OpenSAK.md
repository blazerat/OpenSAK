# Removing Old OpenSAK Versions (Windows / Linux / macOS)

OpenSAK does **not** come with an installer or uninstaller — it's distributed as a
portable `.exe` (Windows), an AppImage (Linux), or a `.dmg` (macOS). That means
"installing" a new version is just running a new file, and the old one doesn't
get removed automatically. This guide explains what OpenSAK actually creates on
your computer and how to clean it up safely, if you want to.

> **You usually don't need to do this.** Downloading a newer release and running
> it will not conflict with an older copy — they're just separate files. This
> guide is for people who specifically want to free up space, do a clean
> reinstall, or fully remove OpenSAK from their machine.

## ⚠️ Before you delete anything

Your **database file(s)** (`.db`, plus matching `-shm` / `-wal` files) contain
all your caches, logs, waypoints, and notes. There is no undo once they're
deleted. If in doubt:

1. Find your database folder (see below).
2. Copy the `.db` files somewhere safe (a USB stick, another folder, cloud
   storage) before deleting anything.

If you're running **1.14.0-beta or later**, the easiest way to see your exact
paths is inside the app itself: **Settings → Advanced** shows your current
*Install folder* and *Database folder* directly — no guessing needed.

## What OpenSAK creates on your computer

There are two completely separate things:

1. **The program itself** — the `.exe`, the AppImage, or the `.app` you
   downloaded/dragged into place. Deleting this removes the program but
   leaves your data untouched.
2. **Your data** — settings, database(s), and log file, created the first
   time you run OpenSAK. This is what you'd want to back up or remove
   separately.

Where your data lives depends on which version you're running, because this
changed in version 1.14.0:

| | Versions **before** 1.14.0 | Versions **1.14.0-beta and later** |
|---|---|---|
| Settings | Windows Registry / Qt `.ini`/`.conf` file under an **"OpenSAK Project"** key or folder | A plain `opensak.json` file, located via a small `bootstrap.json` pointer file |
| Language only | `preferences.json` | merged into `opensak.json` |
| Database(s) | Same folder as settings | A folder you chose in the welcome wizard (can be the same folder, or a different one) |
| Logs | `opensak.log` (same folder) | `opensak.log` inside the install folder |

If you upgraded from an older version to 1.14.0+, OpenSAK automatically copied
your old settings into the new `opensak.json` the first time it ran. The old
registry/`.ini` entries are no longer used after that — they're just leftover
clutter and are safe to delete if you want a clean system.

## Windows

### 1. Remove the program

OpenSAK on Windows is a single portable `.exe`. Just delete the file (and any
shortcut you may have pinned to the Start Menu, Taskbar, or Desktop — OpenSAK
doesn't create these automatically, so only remove ones you made yourself).

### 2. Find your data

**If you're on 1.14.0-beta or later**, open OpenSAK → **Settings → Advanced**
to see the exact Install folder and Database folder paths, then go there in
File Explorer.

**Default locations**, if you never changed them:

| What | Typical path |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap pointer (1.14.0+) | `%APPDATA%\opensak\bootstrap.json` |
| Install folder / `opensak.json` / log (1.14.0+, default) | `%APPDATA%\opensak\` |
| Database, settings, logs (pre-1.14.0, default) | `%APPDATA%\opensak\` |

`%APPDATA%` is usually `C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Roaming`. To get there
quickly: press **Win + R**, type `%APPDATA%`, press Enter.

### 3. Remove old QSettings (pre-1.14.0 leftovers)

Older versions also stored some settings directly in the Windows Registry
under an organization name of **"OpenSAK Project"**. To check and remove this:

1. Press **Win + R**, type `regedit`, press Enter.
2. Press **Ctrl+F**, search for `OpenSAK Project`.
3. If found (usually under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OpenSAK Project`),
   right-click that key → **Delete**.

This step is optional — it only contains old preference values and is never
read by 1.14.0+ versions.

### 4. Delete the data folder (optional, only if you want a clean slate)

Once backed up, delete the `%APPDATA%\opensak\` folder (and the registry key
above, if present) to remove all traces of OpenSAK.

## Linux

### 1. Remove the program

Just delete the AppImage file you downloaded (wherever you saved it — often
`~/Applications`, `~/Downloads`, or `~/.local/bin`).

If you integrated it into your application menu using a tool like
**AppImageLauncher** or `appimaged`, also remove the generated launcher entry
and icon it created, typically:

```bash
ls ~/.local/share/applications/ | grep -i opensak
ls ~/.local/share/icons/ -R | grep -i opensak
```

Delete any matching files found.

### 2. Find your data

**If you're on 1.14.0-beta or later**, check **Settings → Advanced** inside
the app for the exact paths.

**Default locations**, if you never changed them:

| What | Typical path |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap pointer (1.14.0+) | `~/.config/opensak/bootstrap.json` |
| Install folder / `opensak.json` / log (1.14.0+, default) | `~/.local/share/opensak/` |
| Database, settings, logs (pre-1.14.0, default) | `~/.local/share/opensak/` |
| Old QSettings file (pre-1.14.0) | `~/.config/OpenSAK Project/` (filename `OpenSAK.conf` or `OpenSAK.ini`) |

These are hidden folders (starting with a dot). In most file managers, press
**Ctrl+H** to show hidden files, or use a terminal:

```bash
ls -la ~/.config | grep -i opensak
ls -la ~/.local/share | grep -i opensak
```

### 3. Delete the data (optional)

Once you've backed up your `.db` files, you can remove the folders found
above with:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/opensak
rm -rf ~/.config/opensak
rm -rf "~/.config/OpenSAK Project"
```

(Only run commands for folders that actually exist on your system — check
with `ls` first, as shown above.)

---

## macOS

### 1. Remove the program

If you haven't already, drag **OpenSAK.app** out of `/Applications` and into
the **Trash**, then empty the Trash. You can also delete the `.dmg` installer
file you originally downloaded — once the app is copied to `/Applications`,
the `.dmg` itself isn't needed anymore (eject it first if it's still mounted
on your Desktop).

### 2. Find your data

**If you're on 1.14.0-beta or later**, check **Settings → Advanced** inside
the app for the exact paths.

**Default locations**, if you never changed them:

| What | Typical path |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap pointer (1.14.0+) | `~/Library/Application Support/opensak/bootstrap.json` |
| Install folder / `opensak.json` / log (1.14.0+, default) | `~/Library/Application Support/opensak/` |
| Database, settings, logs (pre-1.14.0, default) | `~/Library/Application Support/opensak/` |
| Old QSettings preferences (pre-1.14.0) | `~/Library/Preferences/` (a `.plist` file with "opensak" somewhere in its name) |

To get to `~/Library` quickly: in Finder, click **Go** in the menu bar, hold
**Option**, and **Library** will appear in the list (it's hidden by default).
Or use **Go → Go to Folder...** and type `~/Library/Application Support`.

If you're not sure of the exact preferences filename, search for it in
Terminal:

```bash
find ~/Library/Preferences -iname "*opensak*"
find ~/Library/Application\ Support -iname "*opensak*"
```

### 3. Delete the data (optional)

Once backed up, remove what was found above, e.g.:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/opensak
rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/<the file found above>
```

## Quick checklist

1. ✅ Back up your `.db` file(s) somewhere safe.
2. ✅ Delete the old program file (`.exe` / AppImage / `.app`).
3. ✅ (Optional) Delete the settings/database folder for your OS, listed above.
4. ✅ (Optional, pre-1.14.0 leftovers only) Remove the old Registry key /
   `~/.config/OpenSAK Project` folder / macOS `.plist` file.
5. ✅ Run your new OpenSAK version — it will recreate what it needs, or pick
   up your existing database if you kept it.

If anything looks different on your system than described here — for
example, you changed the install or database folder during the welcome
wizard — check **Settings → Advanced** in the app first; it always shows
your *actual* current paths.
