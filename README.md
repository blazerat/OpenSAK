## Features

### Import & Database
- 📥 **Import** GPX files and Pocket Query ZIP files from Geocaching.com
- 🗄️ **Multiple databases** — keep regions separate (e.g. Zealand, Bornholm, Cyprus)
- 📍 **Home points** — save multiple named home points (Home, Cottage, Hotel…) and switch instantly from the toolbar
- ✅ **Update finds** from a reference database (e.g. your "My Finds" PQ)

### Trip Planning
- 🗺️ **Trip Planner** (`Ctrl+T`) — plan a geocaching trip in two modes:
  - **Radius** — find caches within a set distance from your active home point; sort by distance, difficulty, terrain, date or name
  - **Route A→B→…** — find caches along a multi-point route (up to 10 waypoints); caches sorted in driving order along the route
- Route points can be typed in any coordinate format or picked from your saved home points
- **Preview on map** — open selected trip caches on an interactive map with one click
- Export trip caches directly to GPS or as a GPX file

### View & Navigation
- 🗺️ **Interactive map** with OpenStreetMap and colour-coded cache pins with clustering
- 🔍 **Advanced filter dialog** — 6 tabs: General, Dates, Other, Attributes (~70 Groundspeak attributes), Text Search, and a raw SQL WHERE tab
- 📊 **Configurable columns** — 17+ columns, toggle on/off
- 🎨 **Color-coded status** — found (yellow) and your own caches (green) in the GC Code column and info bar, archived/disabled caches in red; clickable info-bar counts filter the list instantly
- 🔗 **Click GC code** → opens cache page on geocaching.com
- 🗺️ **Click coordinates** → opens in Google Maps or OpenStreetMap

### Cache Details
- 📋 **Cache details** — description, hints, logs, attributes, personal notes, and child waypoints, each in their own tab
- 🔓 **ROT13 hint decoding** — one click to decode / re-hide the hint
- 🔍 **Search in logs** — real-time search with match highlighting; links in log text are clickable
- 📝 **Personal notes** — your own free-text notes per cache, round-trippable with GSAK (`gsak:UserNote`)
- 🧩 **Child waypoints** — parking spots, trail heads, and stages imported from GPX, shown on the map and in a dedicated tab; caches with waypoints show in **bold** in the list
- 🔒 **Lock caches** — freeze a cache's core fields (name, type, coordinates, D/T, owner, status, descriptions, hint…) against being overwritten by a later re-import
- 📍 **Corrected coordinates** — store solved puzzle coordinates per cache; used in GPS export and shown on map
- ✏️ **Add / edit / delete** caches manually

### Right-click Menu
- 🌐 Open on geocaching.com
- 🗺️ Open in map app (Google Maps / OpenStreetMap)
- 📋 Copy GC code / coordinates (in your chosen format)
- ☑ Mark as found / not found
- 🔒 Lock / unlock cache — protect against import overwrites
- 📍 Add / edit / clear corrected coordinates
- ⇄ Open coordinate converter directly from the cache list

### GPS Export
- 📤 **Send to Garmin GPS** — auto-detects USB-mounted Garmin devices
- 🗑️ **Optional: delete existing GPX files** on device before upload
- 💾 **Save as GPX file** — export to any location

### Geocaching Tools
- **⇄ Coordinate Converter** — convert between DD, DMM and DMS formats with one click
- **📐 Coordinate Projection** — calculate a new coordinate from bearing and distance
- **🔢 Digit Checksum** — sum all digits in a coordinate (N/S and E/W separately)
- **⊕ Midpoint** — find the great-circle midpoint between two coordinates
- **📏 Distance & Bearing** — distance and azimuth between two coordinates
- All tools open pre-filled with the currently selected cache's coordinates

### Language Support
- 🌍 **Danish, English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, German, Czech and Swedish** built in
- 🔧 **Easy to add new languages** — copy one file, translate, done

## Known Limitations

- Favourite points cannot be imported from GPX/PQ files (requires Geocaching.com API)
- No Geocaching.com Live API integration
- GPS auto-detection on Linux may not find all Garmin devices automatically
- macOS builds are not signed with an Apple Developer certificate (right-click → Open on first launch)
